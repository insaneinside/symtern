//! Traits that define the interface for all string-interning implementations.
//!
//! Interners are used to provide trivially-comparable stand-ins for values
//! that are not trivially comparable, and to later retrieve the value
//! represented by each stand-in.  (If you don't need the original value after
//! interning, you should probably be using hash functions instead.)
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! This library uses the term "symbol" to refer to a stand-in value.
//! Interners, which both intern and resolve symbols, are called pools (in
//! reference to a "pool" of symbols) when discussing concrete
//! interner/resolver implementations.
//!
//! ## Symbol creation
//!
//! Symbols are created by calling [`intern`] on [`Intern`] implementations.
//!
//! ```rust file="examples/create-resolve.rs" id="create"
//! // Nearly all functionality is in the trait implementations, so we simply
//! // glob-import the traits.
//! use symtern::prelude::*;
//! use symtern::Pool;
//! use symtern::adaptors::Inline;
//!
//!
//! let mut basic_pool = Pool::<str,u16>::new();
//! let cat = basic_pool.intern("Kibbles").expect("Failed to intern the cat");
//!
//! let mut inline_pool = Inline::<Pool<str, u64>>::new();
//! let dog = inline_pool.intern("Fido").expect("Failed to intern the dog");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Symbol resolution
//!
//! Symbols are resolved using the [`Resolve`] trait.  In many cases you can
//! simply pass the symbol to the interner's [`resolve`] method by value:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore file="examples/create-resolve.rs" id="resolve"
//! assert_eq!(Ok("Kibbles"), basic_pool.resolve(cat));
//! ```
//!
//! Some `Resolve` implementations, however, require a _reference_ to
//! the symbol:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore file="examples/create-resolve.rs" id="resolve_ref"
//! assert_eq!(Ok("Fido"), inline_pool.resolve(&dog));
//! ```
//!
//! You can tell the difference by inspect the [`Input`][Resolve::Input]
//! associated type on each [`Resolve`] implementation.
//!
//! ## <strike>Choosing</strike> Chasing our Guarantees
//!
//! Few people enjoy dealing with the fact that software is fallible and
//! operations may fail, but doing so is often a necessary chore.  Sometimes,
//! however, we can eliminate potential error conditions through careful design
//! of an API.  How would we go about doing this for an interner library like
//! Symtern?  We'd like to require that
//!
//!   1. interning never fails, i.e. an interner grows as necessary to hold its
//!      values;
//!
//!   2. resolution never fails:
//!
//!     a. any attempt to resolve a symbol using an interner that did not
//!        create it results in a compile-time error; and
//!
//!     b. interners outlive or contain a copy of the original value, and outlive
//!        the created stand-in.
//!
//! The first condition is untenable for the library's expected use case in
//! combination with practical concerns of performance and efficiency, since
//! a progressively larger address space will require progressively larger
//! representations for symbols.  We *must* handle the address-space-exhausted
//! condition &mdash; especially if our symbols are 32 bits or fewer.
//!
//! There is no way to enforce the second condition (2a) in the general case
//! using features available in present-day Rust.  We can restrict which _type_
//! of wrong interner one can attempt to resolve the symbol on, but without
//! something like [Scala's path-dependent types] we can't generally enforce
//! the condition using compile-time checks.[ยน](#footnote-1) What's worse, we
//! can't even promise zero-cost run-time checks!
//!
//! The third condition (2b), at least, can be satisfied using Rust's lifetime
//! system.  With a naive implementation, however, we find we can only create
//! one stand-in object at a time!
//!
//! ```rust,ignore file="tests/compile-fail/naive-lifetime-safety.rs"
//! struct MyInterner {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! struct Sym<'a> {
//!     marker: ::std::marker::PhantomData<&'a ()>,
//!     // ...
//! }
//! impl MyInterner {
//!     fn new() -> Self {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//!     fn intern<'a>(&'a mut self, s: &str) -> Sym<'a> {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut interner = MyInterner::new();
//! let x = interner.intern("x");
//! let y = interner.intern("y");        //~ ERROR cannot borrow `interner` as mutable more than once at a time
//! ```
//!
//! This happens because rustc's borrowck sees that `intern` takes a mutable
//! reference to the `MyInterner` instance and returns a symbol with the same
//! lifetime, and infers that this symbol has (mutably) borrowed the interner
//! through the reference.  To fix this we can do one of the following.
//!
//!   * Change `intern` to take `&self` and instead employ interior mutability
//!     through `RefCell`, `Mutex`, or similar.
//!
//!   * Remove the lifetime from `Sym`, and lose any lifetime-safety
//!     guarantees.
//!
//! ### Vacuous Promises and Viable Features
//!
//! As we've just seen, we *are* going to be doing error handling for both
//! symbol creation *and* symbol resolution unless we heavily restrict or
//! change the ways in which the library can be used.  But maybe we can employ
//! the lifetime-safety guarantee in such a way that the benefits outweigh the
//! burden of requiring implementations to use interior mutability.
//!
//! One example is a method that clears (resets) an interner:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//!     fn intern<'a>(&'a self, s: &str) -> Sym<'a> { /* ... */ }
//!     fn clear(&mut self) { /* ... */ }
//! ```
//!
//! Because `clear` borrows `self` mutably, it cannot be called until all
//! immutable borrows held by `Sym<'a>` instances have ended.
//!
//! ## Footnotes
//!
//! <a name="footnote-1">ยน</a>: We *could* produce symbols tied to the source
//! interner, but the method of doing so would impose severe restrictions on
//! the ways the library could be used.  Using an approach called
//! "generativity", symbols would be valid only within the scope of a closure
//! passed as a second argument to `intern` , as exemplified in the
//! [indexing] crate.
